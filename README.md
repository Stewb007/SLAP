# SLAP
A Student Learning Access Portal Interface software.

Intended to enhance administration of university courses by facilitating communication, coordination, and assignment submission among students, and between students and their instructors.

The following features are considered to be in scope for the SLAP
Interface:
● Allowing designated administrators to create courses and manage
the assigned instructors and students for each course.
● Instructors can create assignments, perform evaluations, and
communicate with students.
● Students can view assignments and grades, submit work,
communicate with other students, as well as with instructors.
● An announcement page is displayed for all users upon login which
will display any SLAPS they have been sent since their last login.
The following desirable features are considered Out of Scope for this
phase of the SLAP Interface:
● The system does not include server software nor APIs for
communicating with information repositories such as RAMSS.
● SLAP does not afford the capability for instructors to post lecture
notes or other non-assignment related content online.
● The system should monitor performance characteristics and
resource usage, so as to, for instance, warn the administrator or an
instructor if he or she is exceeding a storage quota.
